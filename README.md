# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
My project goals are to shed light on insights for tuberculosis incidences in the world since 1990. TB has been a major worldwide headconcern that can affect anyone on the earth and it is important to find patterns regarding its prevalence and incidence to initiate measures to reduce incidence levels. 

## Process
Step 1 - Firstly I import and gather the data from the appropriate sources on the internet.
Step 2 - This step focuses on reading through and understanding the data that was gathered and thinking about what questions and insights I can derive from it. 
Step 3 - Making different visualizations based on the data and certain questions I want answered such as which sountry has the highest cased of TB throughout history, what is the disparity between estimated prevalence and incidence in each country, and how many people have died through out history  because of TB and what is the trend. 
Step 4 - Make a dashboard that covers a few major visualizations and that is interactive to allow from viewers to easily see insights and answers to questions they may have on TB.
